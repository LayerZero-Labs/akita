//! Sampling-family configuration for [`crate::SparseChallenge`].
//!
//! Many lattice protocols sample "short/sparse" ring challenges whose coefficients
//! are mostly zero and whose non-zero coefficients come from a tiny integer
//! alphabet (e.g. `{±1}` or `{±1,±2}`). [`SparseChallengeConfig`] enumerates the
//! supported families and exposes the policy questions that the rest of the
//! workspace asks of a configured challenge:
//!
//! - [`SparseChallengeConfig::l1_mass`] — worst-case integer `L1` mass; drives
//!   folded-witness bounds in `akita-config` / `akita-planner`.
//! - [`SparseChallengeConfig::max_abs_coeff`] — largest `|c|` that can appear.
//! - [`SparseChallengeConfig::domain_separator_bytes`] — canonical byte tag
//!   absorbed by the sampler before drawing the PRG seed.
//! - [`SparseChallengeConfig::validate`] — sanity-check the family parameters
//!   against a chosen ring degree `D`.
//!
//! All families produce the same sampled output type [`crate::SparseChallenge`].
//! The actual sampler that turns this config plus a transcript into challenges
//! lives in [`crate::sampler`]; this file is policy-only and has no transcript
//! or PRG dependency.
