## Scope and selection

A binary source is a commitment-group kind in the canonical grouped PCS. The
caller commits, supplies an optional binary word claim over GF(2^128) and/or
prime evaluation claims, and uses the
ordinary grouped opening entry points inside the caller's transcript. A carrier-level
field switch produces an internal binary terminal before the root checks
the source relation and repacks its bounded coefficients into the ordinary
negacyclic witness. The existing grouped recursion and terminal then finish
the same proof.

The implementation is available through the default-off `labinius-trinomial`
feature. Selecting a binary source handle and a word or prime claim selects the
extension at runtime. Enabling the feature alone does not select it. Ordinary
groups retain their existing encoding and protocol path.

This is an experimental arithmetic and protocol fixture, with no security
claim. It uses `P = 2^128 - 275`, base-field challenges (`E = F`), and the
Lagrange basis. It admits one binary group first, with at most one ordinary
group second. A binary group may contain several polynomials. It requires an ordinary successor fold whose predecessor setup
contribution is evaluated directly. It does not add a production binary
planner profile or certify a new schedule.

## Commitment and word-claim interfaces

The [binary commitment manifest](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/commitment_manifest.rs)
freezes a rank-three A matrix over the degree-648 minus trinomial ring modulo
`q = 14,253,409`, and an uncompressed rank-two B matrix over the degree-64
negacyclic ring modulo P. Its ordinary carrier profile identifies only the
suffix schedule. The actual A/B setup identities are separate descriptor
fields. Typed setup labels distinguish the q-valued A stream, the P-valued
image commitment and the P-valued opening commitment.

The relevant new declarations are:

```rust
impl BinaryCommittedGroupManifest {
    pub fn commitment_profiles(
        index: &BinaryIndexMap,
        polynomials: usize,
        setup_group: u64,
    ) -> Result<BinaryCommitmentProfiles, AkitaError>;

    pub fn new(
        descriptor: BinarySourceDescriptor,
        setup_group: u64,
        carrier_profile: &GroupCommitPhaseParams,
    ) -> Result<Self, AkitaError>;
}

impl<F, E> CpuBackend<F, E>
where
    F: Field + CanonicalEncoding + 'static,
    E: Field + 'static,
{
    pub fn import_binary_source(
        &self,
        manifest: BinaryCommittedGroupManifest,
        carrier_profile: GroupCommitPhaseParams,
        words: Vec<Vec<u128>>,
    ) -> Result<SourceHandle<F, E>, AkitaError>;
}

impl BinaryWordClaim {
    pub fn new(
        descriptor: &BinarySourceDescriptor,
        polynomial: [u8; 32],
        point: Vec<[u8; 16]>,
        value: [u8; 16],
    ) -> Result<Self, AkitaError>;
}

impl<'a, E: Field, F: Field + CanonicalEncoding>
    PolynomialGroupClaims<'a, E, CommittedGroup<F>>
{
    pub fn new_binary(
        commitment: CommittedGroup<F>,
        claim: BinaryWordClaim,
    ) -> Result<Self, AkitaError>;
}
```

Each inner `words` vector supplies one polynomial's logical words. The CPU
backend applies the descriptor's signed index map, forms `T = A s mod q`,
chooses centered representatives, and stores T as three-byte offset words.
The ordinary B commitment binds T's eight balanced base-eight digits. T remains
a private hint. The public output is a `CommittedGroup` carrying the ordinary
payload and the typed binary manifest; its binary wire format carries both.
The canonical backend `commit` operation uses `GroupContext::explicit` with
the manifest's carrier profile.

`BinaryWordClaim` identifies one polynomial and claims its logical word
multilinear extension (MLE) at `point`. Coordinates and value use the unique
16-byte, low-degree-first polynomial-basis encoding of
`H = GF(2^128) = F2[X]/(X^128 + X^7 + X^2 + X + 1)`. No wider word field is
admitted. The constructor checks polynomial ownership and the descriptor's
complete point dimension. The descriptor fixes the public coordinate split
between intra-carrier word slots and carrier addresses; callers cannot change
that split independently of the commitment contract.

The opening accepts at most one word claim per polynomial identifier.
`OpeningClaims::from_groups` rejects a second binary claim on the same
polynomial with `AkitaError::InvalidInput`, including claims in separate groups.
Applications reduce multiple points before invoking the opening. Akita provides
no application-side H reduction helper.

The canonical word-claim bytes bind the polynomial identifier, complete point
and value at order zero. `BinaryTerminalClaim` is produced inside the opening
at order two; no caller-facing grouped opening accepts one directly. Its point
and value use canonical 21-byte GF(2^162) encodings with zero unused high bits.
The root authenticates the produced whole-carrier terminal through its existing
parity and value relations.

The result enters `OpeningClaims::from_groups`, the existing selection APIs,
`AkitaCommitmentScheme::batched_prove_in_session` and
`AkitaVerifier::batched_verify_in_session`. There is one proof type, one
caller transcript and one grinding-plan cursor. No standalone binary PCS,
nested session seed or separate root transcript is invoked. The caller can
continue using its live transcript after verification and checks exhaustion
at its chosen proof boundary.

## Opening order

The following table records the restricted protocol order. The order numbers
identify the state transitions of the binary source opening contract.

| Order | Implemented action | Fixed before the next challenge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Bind caller context, setup, selected schedule, group kinds, commitments, binary manifest, the optional word claim, every unique prime plane's polynomial, canonical P point, tensor-component tag and value, and any ordinary point/value. | The complete public statement. |
| 2 | Send 128 H carrier partials; draw seven B row-selector coordinates; run n degree-two B sumcheck rounds; send the whole-carrier terminal value. | All partials precede the row selector; each round message precedes its challenge; the terminal precedes U and the column challenges. |
| 3 | Commit the selected U table and every EP plane in one ordinary D payload. U uses one digit; EP coefficients use 43 centered balanced digits. | U precedes all column challenges. |
| 4 | Send the ordinary response nonce and draw the indexed binary column challenges; the mixed ordinary group uses complete preimages rather than a column-fold response. | The accepted bounded response Z. |
| 5 | Commit the outgoing witness containing Z/T digits, selected U/EP views, selected K/K_val, and KA; a mixed opening also includes ordinary commitment preimages. | Every witness segment precedes relation batching. |
| 7 | Draw the shared ring-switch challenge and row-batching weights, together with the range-image point; evaluate direct setup and public weights. | All tested tables and commitments. |
| 8 | Run the ordinary Stage 1 range-image sumcheck with the base-eight digit alphabet. | The range-image terminal precedes Stage 2 batching. |
| 9 | Run one fused Stage 2 for the A quotient, B/D authentication, selected parity/value and prime response/reading equations, padding, and range-image binding; include ordinary relations when selected. | One final opening of the same outgoing witness. |
| 10 | Omit root Stage 3: direct setup evaluation at order 7 replaces its adjoint proof and prefix claims. | The authenticated root opening passed to the suffix. |
| 11 | Continue ordinary grouped recursion and terminal verification. | Return the live caller transcript and, through the readings API, authenticated readings with the conditional-agreement contract; the caller checks exact proof exhaustion. |

Orders 1 and 6 are absent: application reductions happen before this opening,
and there are no projections. The committed-quotient fallback replaces the
projection protocol. Direct public weights replace an equality
tree or a new bilinear wiring compiler.

## Carrier-level field switch

Let the descriptor's word width be a power of two `ell <= 128`, and let
`w_per = 128/ell`. The padded source has `N = 2^n` carriers in canonical index
order. The logical word claim point splits as
`r' = (r_intra, r_addr)`, with `log2(w_per)` low coordinates selecting a word
slot and n remaining coordinates selecting a carrier. Logical words occupy
the low ell bits of H. The descriptor's
[`claim_variable_split`](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/index.rs)
publishes this split.

For carrier payload bit `s = w*ell + u`, define the public H coefficient and
F2-linear map

```text
c_s = eq_H(r_intra, w) X^u
L(x) = sum_(s=0..127) bit_s(x) c_s.
```

The logical word MLE value is therefore
`v = sum_i eq_H(r_addr,i) L(carrier_i)`. When `ell = 128`, `r_intra` is empty
and L is the identity. Narrow words change only this public map; the source
terminal still evaluates complete carriers.

Write `e_i = eq_H(r_addr,i)`, and define the ordinary carrier partials

```text
q[k] = XOR_(i : bit_k(e_i)=1) carrier_i,  k = 0..127.
```

Because L commutes with XOR, the verifier checks the bound word value by
`v = sum_(k=0..127) X^k L(q[k])`. This is implemented by
[`BinaryWordClaim::reconstructed_value`](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/word_claim.rs).
It does not apply L to the authenticated source terminal.

The order-two transcript sequence is exact:

1. Exchange `q[0]` through `q[127]`, each as 16 canonical H bytes. All 2,048
   bytes enter the caller's transcript before any row-selector coordinate.
2. Check `v = sum_k X^k L(q[k])`. Failure is `AkitaError::InvalidProof` on
   verification.
3. Draw seven independent uniform B coordinates `lambda[0..7]`, where
   `B = GF(2^162)`. A challenge uses 162 bits from a transcript challenge block,
   masking unused high bits; there is no odd-prime reduction or modulo bias.
4. Start the sumcheck at `a = sum_k eq_B(lambda,k) phi(q[k])`, where phi is
   F2-linear low-coordinate inclusion from H to B, not a field homomorphism.
   The relation is
   `a = sum_i W(i) phi(carrier_i)`, with
   `W(i) = sum_k eq_B(lambda,k) bit_k(e_i)`.
5. For each carrier-address axis `j = 0..n`, exchange the quadratic
   coefficients `c0` and `c2` as 21 bytes each, then draw uniform `z[j]` in B.
   The linear coefficient is `c1 = a + c2`, since characteristic two gives
   `g(0)+g(1) = c1+c2 = a`. Update `a = c0 + c1*z[j] + c2*z[j]^2`.
6. Exchange the mandatory 21-byte whole-carrier source value t. Check
   `a = W_tilde(z) t` using the transparent weight evaluator. Retain t as the
   internal root obligation even if `W_tilde(z) = 0`. Never divide by the
   transparent weight and never omit or replace the terminal when it is zero.

The canonical prover and verifier use the existing field-switch arithmetic
and packed kernels from `akita-algebra`. They exchange messages through the
ordinary proof stream inside the caller's transcript. They do not invoke the
standalone driver or depend on its crates.

### Terminal coordinate mapping

For `C = 2^c` commitment columns, the descriptor maps carrier index i to column
`b = i mod C` in the low bits and scalar row `r = floor(i/C)` above them.
Point coordinate zero controls the low table-index bit in both the arithmetic
field switch and the root equality tensors. The n sumcheck coordinates split
as

```text
rho_col = z[..c]
rho_row = z[c..]
terminal.value = t = sum_i eq_B(z,i) phi(carrier_i).
```

The seven lambda coordinates batch partial rows only. They contribute no
source-address coordinate. The root's
[`binary_row_partials`](../crates/akita-cpu-backend/src/binary_root/evaluation.rs)
contracts over scalar rows inside each column, and
[`relation_weights`](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/evaluation_weights.rs)
uses the same separate row and column equality tensors. Thus its final
column contraction authenticates precisely the terminal above, including the
published permutation between canonical carriers and column-contiguous
source packing.

### Frontend soundness and proof bytes

For N carriers, the frontend's interactive algebraic error is at most
`(7 + 2n)/2^162`: `7/2^162` for the degree-seven row-selector test and
`2n/2^162` for the n degree-two product-sumcheck rounds. This is the frontend
term, separate from the root authentication, setup, binding and hash terms.
The public F2-linear map L introduces no additional random test. Any H
multi-point reduction belongs to the application and its error ledger; this
opening performs none and charges no H-reduction term. These algebraic bounds
do not certify a production schedule or an overall Fiat-Shamir security level.

Order two adds exactly
`128*16 + 21*(2n+1) = 2048 + 21*(2n+1)` proof bytes: 128 H partials, two B
coefficients per round and one B source terminal. Challenges and the public
word claim add no proof bytes. For the fixture `n = 3`, the frontend adds
2,195 bytes to both binary-only and mixed openings. Subsequent transcript
challenges change, so downstream variable-length encodings can also affect
the measured total proof size.

## Relations and authenticated repacking

All identities below use integer coefficient lifts before reduction modulo P.
Let `Phi = Z^162 + Z^81 + 1`; `rem_Phi` denotes its reduced remainder.
The root enforces:

```text
RA = q KA
rem_Phi(sum_r Br V0_r - sum_b U_b c_b) = 2 K
rem_Phi(sum_b E_b U_b) - v = 2 K_val
```

Here Br and E_b are direct binary equality weights from the terminal point,
V0 is the low response-digit view, and c is the binary fold challenge. K has
nine balanced base-eight digits per coefficient and K_val has six. KA's depth
comes from its checked honest-carry bound. Their tables are committed at
order 5 and are never transmitted in the clear. U has no Booleanity predicate;
admission uses its full malicious digit interval `[-4, 3]`.

[BinaryRootPublic](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/root_public.rs)
constructs the shared linear relation, including direct authentication of T
against the public B payload and the U view against D. Stage 1 range-checks
the outgoing digit table, and Stage 2 binds the range image and linear
identities to its one witness opening. The
[repacking plan](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/root_plan.rs) gives
every native coefficient its ordinary witness address and authenticates zero
padding. This coefficient repacking is not a ring homomorphism.

The mixed specialization samples only the binary column challenges at order 4.
It fixes complete ordinary preimages at order 5 instead of folding an ordinary
response; this costs more witness space and restricts the admitted source.
A mixed opening adds the ordinary source S, ordinary A-image T digits, and
both ordinary commitment-compression bit tables to the same outgoing witness.
Direct Stage 2 weights enforce A, B, both compression maps and the ordinary
evaluation. The compression bits satisfy their existing `{-1, 0}` predicate;
this predicate is separate from the binary U contract. The supported ordinary
profile has one polynomial, one inner digit, base-eight outer digits and
exactly two 128-bit compression maps. Every native ring degree must be at most
648, as budgeted by the root grinding plan. Its source coefficients must fit one
balanced base-eight digit. The current mixed fixture uses only zero and one.
Unsupported geometries produce typed errors.

## Checked fixture bounds

The fixture uses 128-bit words, eight padded carriers, `M = 4` scalar rows,
`C = 2` columns and `m = 1` degree-648 source row. The challenge operator bound
is `Gamma = 92`. The matrix bound is `B_A = 7,126,704`, the response bound is
`B_Z = 2,340`, and the enforced image magnitude is `B_T = 9,586,980`.

The admission implementations are
[BinaryQuotientBounds](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/quotient.rs) and
[BinaryEvaluationBounds](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/evaluation_bounds.rs).
Both use checked integer arithmetic and reject equality at a strict no-wrap
threshold. For `P = 340282366920938463463374607431768211181`:

| Quantity | Fixture result |
| --- | ---: |
| Honest KA bound `ceil(B_A (972 m B_Z + C Gamma) / q)` | 1,137,332 |
| KA digits; enforced BKA | 8; 9,586,980 |
| `LR = 972 m B_A B_Z + C Gamma B_T` | 16,211,309,718,240 |
| `LR + q BKA` | 152,858,456,733,060 |
| Quotient margin `P - (LR + q BKA)` | 340282366920938463463374454573311478121 |
| Honest K bound; enforced BK | 4,440; 76,695,844 |
| K no-wrap bound | 153,400,568 |
| K margin | 340282366920938463463374607431614810613 |
| Honest K_val bound; enforced BK_val | 486; 149,796 |
| Value bound `3 × 162 × C × 4 + 1 + 2 BK_val` | 303,481 |
| Value margin | 340282366920938463463374607431767907700 |

The honest carry bounds fit both positive and negative digit reaches. These
integer inequalities justify the selected exact lifts; they do not establish
SIS security, whole-schedule grinding security or application agreement.

## Evidence and remaining interfaces

The canonical fixture is
[binary_source_end_to_end.rs](../crates/akita-pcs/tests/binary_source_end_to_end.rs).
The measured complete proof sizes for its 128-bit-word fixtures are:

| Protocol | Opening | Before field switch | With field switch |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Current | Binary-only | 75,702 | 77,873 |
| Current | Mixed binary/ordinary | 89,811 | 92,116 |
| `dev-protocol` | Binary-only | 70,610 | 72,818 |
| `dev-protocol` | Mixed binary/ordinary | 84,791 | 86,954 |

The additional 8-bit-word fixture measures 77,855 bytes in the current protocol
and 72,792 with `dev-protocol`. The field-switch contribution itself is exactly
2,195 bytes for every three-round fixture. Complete totals also change with
later variable-length encodings after the changed transcript challenges; their
difference is not necessarily 2,195 bytes.

The fixture exercises the caller's prefix and
post-verification squeeze, commitment serialization, kind consistency,
statement mutations, malformed proof bytes, truncation and trailing bytes.
A test-only backend alters T, Z, U, K, K_val, KA or padding before outgoing
commitment. It uses an incorrect public oracle to complete the adversarial
proof; verification must reject using the independently compiled correct oracle.
Each rejection runs behind a panic-catching boundary.

The suite also proves against a commitment to a different source
while retaining the original source witness and independently evaluated claim.
A second authentication test changes D before the challenges while retaining
the original U witness. The test backend completes both adversarial proofs;
the verifier must reject them even though prover and verifier share the
relation compiler. Removing B or D authentication locally makes the respective
rejection test fail.

A direct first-challenge probe invokes the canonical order-zero binder used by
both drivers, on prover and verifier channels. It changes only the manifest,
polynomial identifier, each intra-carrier or carrier-address point coordinate,
H value, binary commitment, or ordinary commitment, point coordinate or
evaluation, and checks that both roles produce the same changed challenge.
Independent wire replay in the frontend differential test checks that all
partials enter the transcript before lambda. Catalogs are loaded from external
schedule artifacts, including the separate dev-protocol catalog.
The structural source check scans the two root orchestration files for
standalone binary driver calls and nested channel creation. It does not inspect
transitive helper calls. Test outcomes belong in the accompanying validation
report.

The field-switch acceptance tests cover the frontend's additional obligations:

- `field_switch_differential_logical_words_and_carrier_terminals` independently
  evaluates logical word MLEs and the carrier terminal for random sources of
  widths 1, 8, 32 and 128. Its four index shapes include odd carrier-address
  dimensions. Independent wire replay also checks the partials-before-lambda
  binding and terminal coordinate split. A local negative control moved the
  lambda draws before partial absorption on both sides; this test failed at
  the independently replayed terminal point. The mutation was reverted.
- `field_switch_rejects_each_partial_and_round_message` alters each of 128
  partials, both messages of every sumcheck round, and the terminal bytes.
- `field_switch_claim_mutations_reject` alters the word value, each point
  coordinate (including every intra-carrier coordinate), and an admitted
  polynomial identifier.
- `field_switch_rejects_false_source_word` changes a source word after fixing
  its honest claim. `field_switch_binary_root_rejects_a_foreign_source_commitment`
  additionally tests authentication against a different committed source.
- `field_switch_zero_multiplier_authenticates_terminal` scripts a zero public
  weight, changes the retained source terminal, and checks rejection by the
  existing root value authentication without division.

The ordinary regression fixture is
[ordinary_grouped_root_bytes.rs](../crates/akita-pcs/tests/ordinary_grouped_root_bytes.rs),
which pins a 70,541-byte ordinary proof. Its feature-disabled and
feature-enabled executions are the compatibility gate when the extension is
unselected. Existing pinned fixtures and goldens remain part of that gate.

The field switch produces `BinaryTerminalClaim` for the existing root. The
direct A-term function
[`binary_direct_a_weights`](../crates/akita-types/src/binary_source/root_plan.rs)
is the replacement point for a typed Stage 3 adjoint. Projections are not
implemented on this branch. Optional EP planes authenticate prime claims as
described below; no prime claim or agreement proof is discharged by a binary
terminal alone.

## Prime evaluation planes

The default-off feature also exposes
`PolynomialGroupClaims::new_binary_planes(commitment, word, primes)`, where
`word: Option<BinaryWordClaim>` and `primes: Vec<PrimePlaneClaim>`. The existing
`new_binary` constructor retains its word-only behavior. A group must contain
at least one word or prime claim. Every prime claim contains:

```rust
pub struct PrimePlaneClaim {
    pub polynomial: usize,
    pub point: Vec<u128>,
    pub tensor_component: u8,
    pub value: u128,
}
```

The polynomial index names its owner in the committed descriptor. Coordinates
and value must be canonical residues strictly less than
`P = 340282366920938463463374607431768211181`. Their transcript encoding is
16-byte little endian, with fixed-width counts and owner indices. The point has
`n + 8` coordinates: eight low scalar-coefficient bits, then the low carrier
column bits, then scalar-row bits. Natural scalar coefficients occupy indices
0 through 161; indices 162 through 255 are virtual zero. Signed ring packing is
undone before this reading, so an honest payload reads as its unsigned bits.

The tensor component is a caller-owned decomposition tag from 0 through 3.
It is bound and counts toward plane identity; it does not impose an extra row
mask or change equality weights. One separable point reads all scalar rows in
one plane. This API does not infer arbitrary nonseparable coefficient weights
from a tag and supplies no application reduction or fusion helper.

`PrimePlaneManifest` is the single admission boundary. It permits at most five
unique `(polynomial, point, tensor_component)` planes in the entire binary
group, hence at most five distinct points. Different polynomials never share a
plane. Exact duplicate requests share the first occurrence and do not change
order-zero bytes, D, witness size, or proof bytes. Conflicting values for the
same functional are invalid. A sixth plane, including one distinguished only
by a component tag or owner, returns `AkitaError::InvalidInput`; it cannot
increase a proof-controlled allocation. Input request lists are also limited
to 4096 entries before deduplication.

For each unique plane, split its point into coefficient, column and row
coordinates. Let `omega_s = eq(rho_coeff,s)`, `h_b = eq(rho_col,b)` and
`e_r = eq(rho_row,r)`, all in P. The prover constructs

```text
EP_b(Z) = sum_r e_r src_(r,b)(Z) mod P
sum_r e_r V_r(Z) = rem_Phi(sum_b c_b(Z) EP_b(Z)) mod P
v_P = sum_b h_b sum_(s=0..161) omega_s EP_b[s] mod P.
```

The response V uses **all four balanced response digits**, with the signed
packing undone. Reading its low digit here would authenticate a different
functional. Each plane uses the challenges of its own polynomial. The first
identity is tested after reduced scalar multiplication and ring switching;
the scalar reading is a separate linear equation. Each receives an independent
row-batching coefficient at order 7 and joins the existing fused Stage 2.

At order 0, the canonical manifest and all unique prime claims are public
messages before any challenge. At order 3, D commits the compact natural-digit
concatenation of U, if selected, followed by all EP planes in first-occurrence
order. Within EP the order is plane, column, digit, natural coefficient. There
is no inter-plane degree-64 padding: only the final D chunk is padded. D is
fixed before the order-4 nonce and indexed column challenges. At order 5, those
same EP digits occupy the outgoing witness with 256-coefficient scalar strides.
D authentication addresses this exact compact-to-padded map. Order 9 proves
the equations above in the same Stage 2 as the ordinary root obligations.
No new proof messages or challenges are inserted after the suffix.

A prime-only opening skips order 2 and omits U, K and K_val completely from
both D and the outgoing witness. It retains the A quotient KA on this branch.
An opening with no prime claims preserves the original word-only transcript
atoms, witness addresses and bytes.

### Representation bounds and error accounting

An EP coefficient is first reduced modulo P and centered in
`[-170141183460469231731687303715884105590,
  170141183460469231731687303715884105590]`. Forty-three balanced base-eight
digits have negative reach `388894133623929672529570979922020813092` and positive
reach `291670600217947254397178234941515609819`, so both centered endpoints fit.
Forty-two digits have positive reach only
`36458825027243406799647279367689451227`, which is insufficient. Forty-three
digits do **not** represent every canonical nonnegative residue: `P-1` exceeds
the positive reach. Centering is required for completeness.

EP identities are equations in P, so they introduce no integer no-wrap
inequality. Their reduced polynomial degree is at most 161. In the interactive
algebraic analysis, an erroneous set of prime polynomial equations survives
a uniform common alpha with probability at most `161/P`; independently
batching the surviving equations contributes at most `1/P`. These bounds do
not multiply by the number of planes: fix any nonzero residual polynomial,
then use independent batching weights. The aggregate root already charges the
conservative degree loss 648 and independent row-batching loss 1; the prime
rows fit those existing bounds. The Stage-2 degree remains three. A widened
domain increases its round count and the associated existing sumcheck loss.
These are algebraic statements, not a whole-protocol Fiat-Shamir or SIS
certificate.

This method constructs the existing conditional-agreement result only after
the complete grouped opening and suffix verify. It returns unique authenticated
prime claims in manifest order and the optional word reading. The terminal
prime digest binds the commitment payload, source descriptor and canonical prime claims using a
domain-separated encoding. Session and group identifiers name context already
authenticated by the caller for this exact committed source. The method adds no transcript messages, preserves
the caller's continuation, and does not check agreement. Agreement remains the
application's proof-token contract in `agreement.rs`; Akita adds neither a
checker nor an application helper. The caller checks final proof exhaustion.

### Planner and admission inputs

`akita_planner::prime_planes::price_binary_root_planes` is behind the planner's
default-off `labinius-trinomial` feature. It uses the verifier's canonical
witness plan, including every unique plane, optional word views, and optional
ordinary preimages. It reports compact D digits/columns, physical segment
widths, the next power-of-two domain, ordinary ring-element count, and an
existing-table D rank lookup. It neither selects an extension nor changes
schedule artifacts.

At C=256, one plane contributes `43*162*256 = 1,783,296` natural digits and
`43*256*256 = 2,818,048` physical cells. Five planes contribute 8,916,480 natural
digits and 14,090,240 physical cells. The compact degree-64 D widths are:

| Planes | Prime-only D columns | With U D columns |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 27,864 | 28,512 |
| 2 | 55,728 | 56,376 |
| 5 | 139,320 | 139,968 |

For the C=2 fixture, five planes add 69,660 natural digits and 110,080 physical
cells; D has 1,089 prime-only columns or 1,094 with U. With the current KA
segment and rank-three A, the complete binary outgoing inputs are:

| Geometry | Five planes, prime-only | Five planes plus word | Minimum domain |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| N=8, C=2 | 187,904 | 192,256 | 262,144 |
| N=2^22, C=256 | 37,195,776 | 37,265,152 | 67,108,864 |
| N=2^23, C=256 | 53,972,992 | 54,042,368 | 67,108,864 |

Optional ordinary preimages add their canonical segment widths before rounding
the domain. The large current-root totals retain 36,864 KA cells
(`12*1024*3`); a protocol that removes KA has different admission inputs.

Balanced digit differences have coefficient bound 7. The existing degree-64,
bound-7 q128 scalar SIS row permits 76,306 columns at rank one and 106,021,444
at rank two. The five-plane D exceeds rank-one coverage and fits the existing
rank-two row; `Q128Offset275` uses that row through `row_owner`. This lookup
covers only the declared D width under that table's model. No new estimator or
full admission certificate has been run for the widened ordinary suffix or
the experimental q24 root. No production certification is asserted.
